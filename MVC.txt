    Issue faced
#######################

- some issue of using record for DTO and using Model mapper for conversion together, used normal class for the DTO
- Did not had to use Json property in my code , it worked fine. find why is that 
- used builder method to manually update the records , find if any better way / production way ?
- getting 500 for a resource not found , handle it gracefully !
