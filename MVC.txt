Custom validation - ( adding custom annotation for the validation) @interface , validated by "our class defination"

// Expolore this
Optinal class ? why ? and when ? 
@JsonProperty why? 
Reflection to update partially
Resposnse Entity for sending the reposnse in better way

    Handing Exception and sending better API Resposne
#######################

@RestControllerAdvice
@ExceptionHandler(<Exception>.class) -> define your logic

#Global Exception Handler

    Issue faced
#######################

- some issue of using record for DTO and using Model mapper for conversion together, used normal class for the DTO
- Did not had to use Json property in my code , it worked fine. find why is that 
- used builder method to manually update the records , find if any better way / production way ?
- was injected "DTOS" - lol
- getting 500 for a resource not found , handle it gracefully !
